# Extended Industrial History Revival
Hello,
this mod is a revival of the seemingly dead [Extended Industrial History](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3012550289) mod. I really love what this mod has to offer, but since it seems it's been abandoned, I decided to update it myself. If that mod gets updated, then by all means use it instead of this - I don't claim the original creator's hard work as my own. 

## Does it work?
Currently, the game doesn't crash, but I doubt it actually works. That's what I'm working on now. I made this repo public after my first commit which didn't crash the game upon loading.

## Can I help?
I've never done a collaborative project for any mod, or anything on Github, so I'm not against help at all but I don't yet know how I'd manage that.
